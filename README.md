Modern login page UI

A modern login page created with the help of a Youtube tutorial. Very simple form and some fun CSS shenanigans!
This took me around 30 minutes to make and I had a lot of fun using some tools with my CSS code that I never really utilised before for some reason, for example Google Fonts and cssgradient.io came in handy.
